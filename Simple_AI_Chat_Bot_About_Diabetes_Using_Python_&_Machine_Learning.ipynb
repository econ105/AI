            "Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.\n",

            "\n",
            "The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be.\n",

            "\n",
            "Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.\n",
            "\n",

type of diabetes.', 'Family history may play a part in all types.', 'Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes.', 'Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies).', 'If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes.', 'But not
